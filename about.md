# About

Code for DC is a [Code for America Brigade](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) located in Washington, DC. Started in 2012, we’re a volunteer group focused on improving the nation’s capital with technology.

But you don’t need to be a technologist to join—we’re a group of journalists, software engineers, policy wonks, data scientists, designers, and other do-gooders. Together, we meet twice a month to discuss issues affecting the city, propose solutions, and hack on some projects.

From an Open Election Map to ANC Finder, we’re committed to solving non-partisan, non-political issues that affect people living across the District.

# Who we are

While our Brigade is always growing, our leadership team is here to keep us on course, serve as a friendly face to new-comers and regulars alike, and of course, bring the pizza.
